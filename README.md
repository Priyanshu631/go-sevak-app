## An Offline-First AI Assistant for Bovine Breed Identification

### üöÄ Features
- **On-Device AI Model:** Utilizes a PyTorch Lite model locally for instant, offline breed classification.
- **Offline-First Functionality:** All predictions are saved locally first, ensuring the app is fully functional without an internet connection.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and login powered by Supabase Auth.
- **Two-Way Cloud Sync:** Data for each authenticated user is securely synced to a Supabase backend.
- **Multi-Device Support:** Synced predictions, including images, are available across all devices for a logged-in user.
- **Cloud Image Storage:** Prediction images are uploaded to Supabase Storage, providing a permanent URL instead of a local path.
- **Robust & Resilient:** Features retry logic for model loading and network requests, with graceful fallbacks for failed uploads.
- **Cross-Platform:** Built with React Native for Android and could be ported to iOS.

### üîç Overview
This project was developed to address a critical challenge faced by Field Level Workers (FLWs) in India: the accurate identification of bovine breeds for the Bharat Pashudhan App. Network instability in rural areas makes cloud-based AI solutions impractical.

**GoSevak** solves this by packaging a trained AI model directly into a React Native application. It allows FLWs to get instant, accurate breed classifications in the field, save their work locally, and sync it to a central database whenever a stable connection is available. This ensures data integrity and improves the effectiveness of national livestock programs.

### üíª Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React Native, TypeScript
- **AI Model:** PyTorch Mobile Lite (`.ptl`)
- **Backend & DB:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Storage)
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Navigation:** React Navigation

### üß† AI Model & Native Implementation
The core of this application is its ability to run complex deep learning models directly on a mobile device.

The full training process can be reviewed in the **[PTH Model Training Notebook](https://github.com/Priyanshu631/bovine-breeds/blob/main/apps/docs/indian-bovine-breeds-classification.ipynb)**.

**Key Insights:**
- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes a `convnext_tiny` model from the `timm` library, fine-tuned on the dataset using transfer learning.
- **Training:** Employs a two-phase training strategy (warmup and fine-tuning) with techniques like data augmentation, Mixup, and weighted sampling to handle class imbalance across 41 breeds.
- **Performance:** Achieved a validation accuracy of **~65%** on the public dataset.
- **Mobile Conversion:** The final `.pth` model was converted to a full-precision (`fp32`) PyTorch Lite (`.ptl`) format to ensure maximum accuracy for offline, on-device inference.
- **Native Bridge:** A custom Kotlin Native Module (`PytorchModule.kt`) was built from scratch to interface with the React Native frontend. This was necessary as the official `react-native-pytorch-core` library was found to be an unsupported dependency for the project's configuration. The native module files can be requested from the contributors.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
- The model was trained on a publicly available, non-curated dataset from Kaggle: **[Indian Bovine Breeds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lukex9442/indian-bovine-breeds)**.
- Due to potential inconsistencies or incorrect labels within this public data, the model's accuracy, while robust, may not reflect the performance achievable with an officially curated and verified dataset.
- Performance can be significantly improved if curated data is provided by the responsible authorities.
- **Hardware Compatibility:** This application is specifically optimized for modern Android phones and targets the **`ARM64-v8a`** architecture to achieve the native performance required for the on-device AI model. This architecture is standard in the overwhelming majority of contemporary smartphones (over 99% of active devices). Please be aware that attempting to run this app on a device or emulator with a different architecture (such as `x86`) will result in a native crash.
